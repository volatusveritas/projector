# ProjectOr Development Journal, Entry #1

ProjectOr has been going well. Even better than I initially thought it every
would, indeed. I managed to successfully internalize types and make the
creation of new types somewhat easy and practical. I'm still extremely far from
perfection, of course, and many things are missing. I'm excited to make new
things and bring new functionality to the language, however, there are other
matters I would prefer taking care of before proceeding, because with a weak
foundation even the hardest of metals falls.
